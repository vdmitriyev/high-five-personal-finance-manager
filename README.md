How To Start
============
* Create proper XS Project in SAP HANA Studio
* Connect new created project to SAP HANA
* Run command line and move to the created workspace with XS Project inside
* git clone current repository
```
git clone https://github.com/vdmitriyev/high-five-personal-finance-manager.git
```

Project Structure
=================
* Directory 'data' contains ready to use data and data generators;
* Directory 'honeymoney' contains SAP HANA Studio XS Project that must be imported into database;

Data Import - Option 1
===================================
* Tables must be generated from '*.hdbtable' files that are located in the directory /honeymoney/data
* To generate tables just activate all '*.hdbtable' files
* Do not forget to give all needed grants (because when tables are created from '*.hdbtable' files is owned by _SYS_REPO, scripts with grants can be found in the following directory /honeymoney/data/sql-scripts)
* Data should be imported from /data/ready_data/* to the already created tables
* How to import data to SAP HANA from local CSV please check this [pdf](https://github.com/vdmitriyev/saphana-demos-bi2course-vlba/blob/master/demo-import-csv-data/import-csv-data.pdf)
* Schema that is used by default is "DEMOUSER00"
* Generated tables: &lt;namespace&gt;::"tbl_users", &lt;namespace&gt;::"tbl_trans_data", &lt;namespace&gt;::"tbl_events"
* NOTE: Note that '&lt;namespace&gt;' is very important and depends to the folder wheere you are storing your project, do not also forget to change '&lt;namespace&gt;' in *.xsjs scripts.

Data Import - Option 2 (Deprecated)
===================================
* Data should be imported from /data/ready_data/*
* How to import data to SAP HANA from local CSV please check this [pdf](https://github.com/vdmitriyev/saphana-demos-bi2course-vlba/blob/master/demo-import-csv-data/import-csv-data.pdf)
* Schema that is used by default is "DEMOUSER00"
* Table names: "TBL_TRANS_DATA", "TBL_USERS"

How to Run "HoneyMoney" inside SAP HANA Cloud Platform
======================================================
* Go through following article by [Stoyan Manchev](http://scn.sap.com/people/stoyan.manchev) to get general understanding of upcoming process ["8 Easy Steps to Develop an XS application on the SAP HANA Cloud Platform"](http://scn.sap.com/community/developer-center/cloud-platform/blog/2013/10/17/8-easy-steps-to-develop-an-xs-application-on-the-sap-hana-cloud-platform#start=100)
* Perform steps 1,2 from article mentioned above, but instead of using "hihanaxs" as application name use "cloudhoneymoney"
* During step 3 while creating project give a name to the project "honeymoney"
* Go to the workspace with created project (must contain "._SYS_REGI_settings" and "&lt;username&gt;trial" directories)
* Inside directory "&lt;username&gt;trial" remove directory "cloudhoneymoney"
* After removing directory "cloudhoneymoney" execute following command (cloning branch for cloud):
```
git clone -b cloud-version https://github.com/vdmitriyev/high-five-personal-finance-manager.git cloudhoneymoney
```
* Go back to SAP HANA Studio and refresh it, now you have to see file from project that are extracted from github
* Deploy files from XS Project(the name of the project should be "honeymoney") to SAP HANA Cloud [deploy files only from "honeymoney" subdirectory !!!]
* Go to the cockpit of SAP HANA Cloud Platform and open "HANA XS Applications" -&gt; "Applications"  and click on link that will lead you to uploaded files of your application
* Change schema from "&lt;sap-hana-cloud-schema-name&gt;" to one generated by SDK (python script "prepare_cloud_version.py" from "misc/scripts/prepare_cloud_version" can be used)
* Change user name "&lt;sap-hana-cloud-username&gt;" to given you in SAP HANA Cloud Cockpit (python script "prepare_cloud_version.py" from "misc/scripts/prepare_cloud_version" can be used)
